          <p class="mb-4">
            Before the world sees your outfit, you feel your foundation. And
            when that foundation is built with provocative cuts and unapologetic
            comfort, it changes the way you move, the way you walk, and the way
            you own your space. Thatâ€™s the power of

            inclusive energyâ€”because self-expression doesnâ€™t start at the
            surface. It starts beneath.

            youâ€™ll find statement intimates that donâ€™t ask permission to
            existâ€”they demand to be seen, felt, and celebrated.

            From sleek, anatomical support briefs to provocative genderless
            silhouettes, each piece reflects the fluidity of modern identity.
            Here, fit isn't binaryâ€”it's bespoke. Style isn't limitedâ€”it's
            liberated.

            includes queerness, fluidity, pride, and rebellion, even the
            smallest piece of clothing becomes a powerful act of
            self-definition.

            DealByEthan.shop isnâ€™t just selling underwearâ€”itâ€™s amplifying
            voices, empowering bodies, and honoring the layered truth of who we
            are. Queer-coded confidence starts beneath. Now let it rise to the
            surface.
